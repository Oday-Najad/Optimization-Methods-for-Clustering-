# Optimization-Methods-for-Clustering-

This project explores the implementation and evaluation of Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants
for solving the Maximum Clique problem in clustering optimization. Specifically, we develop
and implement the Frank-Wolfe, Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, and Away Step Frank-Wolfe algorithms,
incorporating tools such as line search and Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) to enhance efficiency.
These algorithms are tested on the ℓ2 -regularized and ℓ0 -regularized max-clique problems using
three datasets from the DIMACS Instances. The performance and results of these algorithms are
analyzed through various plots, showing how effectively they work for clustering problems.
